If you're going to pay for it, using the **GPT version is a bit better** since the responses render more smoothly.
But you could **try the Gemini 2.5 Flash version** suggested in this post **for testing** before making a decision.

Edited on 2025-12-07 10:46. : Gemini-2.5-flash free usage reduced from 250 to 20. Google made the change, and it may revert or change again, so we'll have to keep an eye on it.
